	  The Cadence MACB ethernet interface is found on many Atmel AT32 and
	  AT91 parts.  This driver also supports the Cadence GEM (Gigabit
	  Ethernet MAC found in some ARM SoC devices).  Say Y to include
	  support for the MACB/GEM chip.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be macb.
