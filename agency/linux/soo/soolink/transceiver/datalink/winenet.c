/*
 * Winenet is implementing a so-called unibroad communication mode that is, a mode where a speaker sends
 * to his neighbours called listeners. These listeners form a group (of listeners). It may happen
 * that a listener appears as neighbour, but is not immediately part of a group.
 *
 * About the Winenet protocol:
 *
 * - When a new smart object (SOO) is showing up in a location where other SOOs are present, it first
 *   needs to ping the others to get know each other. A SOO is considered as "valid" when the ping procedure
 *   has been successfully performed.
 *
 * - As soon as the SOOs are valid to each other, they can start sending/receiving data with a speaker
 *   and listeners. The first speaker is the first in the ascending (agencyUID) list in the (valid)
 *   neighborhood. It does not exclude that two (or more) SOOs starts as speaker simultaneously, when several
 *   SOOs are showing up almost at the same time. However, the "speaker broadcast" process will allow
 *   to converge towards a nominal situation with only one speaker and several listeners.
 *
 * - When scaling with hidden nodes, the major point is the Discovery block which periodically broadcast (for real)
 *   beacons to the other SOOs so that they can get information about potential paired speakers, and decide what
 *   to do (of course, the idea is to preserve wireless interference between several neighbourhoods.
 *
