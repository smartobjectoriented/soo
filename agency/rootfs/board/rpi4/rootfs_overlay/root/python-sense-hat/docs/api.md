### set_pixels

Updates the entire LED matrix based on a 64 length list of pixel values.

Parameter | Type | Valid values | Explanation
--- | --- | --- | ---
`pixel_list` | List | `[[R, G, B] * 64]` | A list containing 64 smaller lists of `[R, G, B]` pixels (red, green, blue). Each R-G-B element must be an integer between 0 and 255.

Returned type | Explanation
--- | ---
None |

```python
from sense_hat import SenseHat

sense = SenseHat()

O = [255, 255, 255]  # White

question_mark = [

### get_pixels

Returned type | Explanation
--- | ---
List | A list containing 64 smaller lists of `[R, G, B]` pixels (red, green, blue) representing the currently displayed image.

```python
from sense_hat import SenseHat

sense = SenseHat()
pixel_list = sense.get_pixels()
```

Note: You will notice that the pixel values you pass into `set_pixels` sometimes change when you read them back with  `get_pixels`. This is because we specify each pixel element as 8 bit numbers (0 to 255) but when they're passed into the Linux frame buffer for the LED matrix the numbers are bit shifted down to fit into RGB 565. 5 bits for red, 6 bits for green and 5 bits for blue. The loss of binary precision when performing this conversion (3 bits lost for red, 2 for green and 3 for blue) accounts for the discrepancies you see.

The `get_pixels` function provides a correct representation of how the pixels end up in frame buffer memory after you've called `set_pixels`.

for i in reversed(range(0,10)):
    sense.show_letter(str(i))

### low_light

Toggles the LED matrix low light mode, useful if the Sense HAT is being used in a dark environment.

```python
import time
from sense_hat import SenseHat

sense = SenseHat()
sense.clear(255, 255, 255)
sense.low_light = True
time.sleep(2)
sense.low_light = False
```

### gamma

For advanced users. Most users will just need the `low_light` Boolean property above. The Sense HAT python API uses 8 bit (0 to 255) colours for R, G, B. When these are written to the Linux frame buffer they're bit shifted into RGB 5 6 5. The driver then converts them to RGB 5 5 5 before it passes them over to the ATTiny88 AVR for writing to the LEDs.

The gamma property allows you to specify a gamma lookup table for the [final 5](http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Final_Five) bits of colour used. The lookup table is a list of 32 numbers that must be between 0 and 31. The value of the incoming 5 bit colour is used to index the lookup table and the value found at that position is then written to the LEDs.

Type | Valid values | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
Tuple or List | Tuple or List of length 32 containing Integers between 0 and 31 | Gamma lookup table for the final 5 bits of colour

```python
import time
from sense_hat import SenseHat

sense = SenseHat()
sense.clear(255, 127, 0)

print(sense.gamma)
time.sleep(2)

sense.gamma = list(reversed(sense.gamma))
print(sense.gamma)
time.sleep(2)

sense.low_light = True
print(sense.gamma)
time.sleep(2)

sense.low_light = False
```

### gamma_reset

A function to reset the gamma lookup table to default, ideal if you've been messing with it and want to get it back to a default state.

Returned type | Explanation
--- | ---
None |

```python
import time
from sense_hat import SenseHat

sense = SenseHat()
sense.clear(255, 127, 0)
time.sleep(2)
sense.gamma = [0] * 32  # Will turn the LED matrix off
time.sleep(2)
sense.gamma_reset()
```

## IMU Sensor

The IMU (inertial measurement unit) sensor is a combination of three sensors, each with an x, y and z axis. For this reason it's considered to be a 9 dof (degrees of freedom) sensor.

- Gyroscope
- Accelerometer
- Magnetometer (compass)

This API allows you to use these sensors in any combination to measure orientation or as individual sensors in their own right.

## Joystick

### InputEvent

A tuple describing a joystick event. Contains three named parameters:

* `timestamp` - The time at which the event occurred, as a fractional number of seconds (the same format as the built-in `time` function)

* `direction` - The direction the joystick was moved, as a string (`"up"`, `"down"`, `"left"`, `"right"`, `"middle"`)

* `action` - The action that occurred, as a string (`"pressed"`, `"released"`, `"held"`)

This tuple type is used by several joystick methods either as the return type
or the type of a parameter.

- - -
### wait_for_event

Blocks execution until a joystick event occurs, then returns an `InputEvent`
representing the event that occurred.

```python
from sense_hat import SenseHat
from time import sleep

sense = SenseHat()
event = sense.stick.wait_for_event()
print("The joystick was {} {}".format(event.action, event.direction))
sleep(0.1)
event = sense.stick.wait_for_event()
print("The joystick was {} {}".format(event.action, event.direction))
```

In the above example, if you briefly push the joystick in a single direction
you should see two events output: a pressed action and a released action.
The optional *emptybuffer* can be used to flush any pending events before
waiting for new events. Try the following script to see the difference:

```python
from sense_hat import SenseHat
from time import sleep

sense = SenseHat()
event = sense.stick.wait_for_event()
print("The joystick was {} {}".format(event.action, event.direction))
sleep(0.1)
event = sense.stick.wait_for_event(emptybuffer=True)
print("The joystick was {} {}".format(event.action, event.direction))
```

- - -
### get_events

Returns a list of `InputEvent` tuples representing all events that have
occurred since the last call to `get_events` or `wait_for_event`.

```python
from sense_hat import SenseHat

sense = SenseHat()
while True:
    for event in sense.stick.get_events():
        print("The joystick was {} {}".format(event.action, event.direction))
```

- - -
### direction_up, direction_left, direction_right, direction_down, direction_middle, direction_any

These attributes can be assigned a function which will be called whenever the
joystick is pushed in the associated direction (or in any direction in the case
of `direction_any`). The function assigned must either take no parameters or
must take a single parameter which will be passed the associated `InputEvent`.

```python
from sense_hat import SenseHat, ACTION_PRESSED, ACTION_HELD, ACTION_RELEASED
from signal import pause

x = 3
y = 3
sense = SenseHat()

def clamp(value, min_value=0, max_value=7):
    return min(max_value, max(min_value, value))

def pushed_up(event):
    global y
    if event.action != ACTION_RELEASED:
        y = clamp(y - 1)

def pushed_down(event):
    global y
    if event.action != ACTION_RELEASED:
        y = clamp(y + 1)

def pushed_left(event):
    global x
    if event.action != ACTION_RELEASED:
        x = clamp(x - 1)

def pushed_right(event):
    global x
    if event.action != ACTION_RELEASED:
        x = clamp(x + 1)

def refresh():
    sense.clear()
    sense.set_pixel(x, y, 255, 255, 255)

sense.stick.direction_up = pushed_up
sense.stick.direction_down = pushed_down
sense.stick.direction_left = pushed_left
sense.stick.direction_right = pushed_right
sense.stick.direction_any = refresh
refresh()
pause()
```

Note that the `direction_any` event is always called *after* all other events
making it an ideal hook for things like display refreshing (as in the example
above).
