The agency is the whole software which is resident within a smart object. It is composed of the ``avz`` hypervisor
and ``Linux`` as the main domain. Actually, the domain is divided in ``domain #0`` which is the non realtime domain
of the agency, and ``domain #1`` which is a hard realtime domain running independently of the Linux scheduler.
The hard realtime domain is a highly modified version of the Xenomai/Cobalt kernel with its RTDM API.

The figure below shows the Agency subsystems and functional blocks.
