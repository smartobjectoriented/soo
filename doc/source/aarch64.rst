Configuration for AArch64 64-bit architecture
=============================================

This chapter is devoted to the AArch64 64-bit configuration.

.. warning::
   
   This is a ongoing work... and should be placed in a branch.
  

QEMU target
-----------

The new platform in the emulated environment is called ``virt64`` (instead of ``virt32``)

The following target is required at the configuration:

.. code:: bash

   cd qemu
   ./configure --target-list=aarch64-softmmu --disable-attr --disable-docs
   make -j8

(The other options may remain unchanged)

(Virtual) SD-card Storage
-------------------------

The virtual storage file can be generated with the following command:

.. code:: bash
   
   ./create_img.sh virt64

U-boot
------

Of course, U-boot must be compiled with the aarch64-linux-gnu toolchain.
Edit the Makefile and change the ``CROSS_COMPILE`` variable.

U-boot can be configured (and rebuilt) as follows:

.. code:: bash
   
   make qemu_arm64_defconfig
   make -j8

.. warning::

   Since the virtio-blk-device of QEMU has a block size of 512 bytes, the uEnv file
   stored in ``uEnv.d`` directory must not be less than 512 bytes.
   
Agency
------

.. warning::

   Do not forget to modify file ``build.conf`` in the *agency/* directory in order to have
   the correct platform.
   
Linux
~~~~~

Again, the Makefile needs to be adpated accordingly, with the correct *CROSS_COMPILE* value, i.e. ``aarch64-linux-gnu``
Furthermore, the **ARCH** variable must be set to ``arm64`` (which corresponds to the subdirectory in *arm/* directory.

- The default configuration to be used is  ``virt64_defconfig``

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Address Space Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Linux address space: 

Virtual addresses are 48-bit

- User space:     0x0000000000000000 - 0x0000800000000000
- Kernel space:   0xffff800000000000 - 0xffffffffffffffff

Constants:

- TEXT_OFFSET = 0x800000
- PHYS_OFFSET = 0x40000000

~~~~~~~~~
Bootstrap
~~~~~~~~~

- The kernel image must have a valid header (used by U-boot) as follows:

.. code-block:: c

   struct Image_header {
      uint32_t code0;      /* Executable code */
      uint32_t code1;      /* Executable code */
      uint64_t text_offset;   /* Image load offset, LE */
      uint64_t image_size; /* Effective Image size, LE */
      uint64_t flags;      /* Kernel flags, LE */
      uint64_t res2;    /* reserved */
      uint64_t res3;    /* reserved */
      uint64_t res4;    /* reserved */
      uint32_t magic;      /* Magic number */
      uint32_t res5;
   };

The structure above is mapped at the beginning of the image, i.e. the first instructions located
at the ``_head`` label. *code0* and *code1* are the location of the two first instructions in *head.S* 
(mainly a branch instruction, encoded on 32-bit as any aarch64 instructions).

Possible kernel flags are::

   Bit 0: Kernel endianness.  1 if BE, 0 if LE.
   Bit 1-2:  Kernel Page size.
         0 - Unspecified.
         1 - 4K
         2 - 16K
         3 - 64K
   Bit 3: Kernel physical placement
         0 - 2MB aligned base should be as close as possible
             to the base of DRAM, since memory below it is not
             accessible via the linear mapping
         1 - 2MB aligned base may be anywhere in physical
             memory
   Bits 4-63:   Reserved.

Current configuration is:
- Kernel Page size unspecified, 2MB aligned base as close as possible to the base of DRAM
  

- Start physical address: 0x40000000 (DRAM base for emulated virt machine in QEMU)

 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MMU and Page Tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The configuration in Linux is 4 KB page size with 4 levels of translation
- Each table as 512 entries, hence with 64-bit entries and is stored in a 4 KB page.
- Bit 63 tells which TTBR0/1 is used (1 -> kernel, 0 -> user space)

AVZ Hypervisor
--------------

- The hypervisor will be located at 0xffff700000000000


Realtime Agency
---------------

- The ``idmap`` page tables have to be built up during the bootstrap of CPU #1 to enable the MMU since these page tables are not configured by CPU #0 (AVZ already enabled the MMU).
- A RT task creation must have a stack aligned on 64-byte
- tpidr_el1 has a reference to the current task_sruct and is used to retrieved the IRQ stack initialized during ``irq_init()``
