This document aims at describing the **SOO.Blind** role, use-cases and architecture.

SOO.blind purpose
=================
The main purpose of **SOO.blind** is to interact with a blind. The blind is accessed through
the KNX bus using a Kberry838. This ME allows to perform basic actions like UP, INCREASE, DECREASE 
and STOP. A more complete control of the blind will be achieved using the SOO android application.

SOO.blind architecture
======================
The figure below shows the general architecture and components used in the SOO environnement by
the ME to interact with the hardware.
